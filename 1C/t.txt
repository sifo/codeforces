1) find R the radius and O(x, y) the center coordonates of the cercle with the given 3 points

2) find how many rotation is necesary to go from one point the exact same point

   We suppose n = 3 and we do n rotaton of a point A.
   If we're back on that point A, then the polygon has n sides.
   Else, we do the same thing for n+1.

3) Determine the polygon area with R and n.
